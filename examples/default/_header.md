# Azure ExpressRoute Circuit Module - Default Example

This example demonstrates how to deploy an Azure ExpressRoute Circuit using the module without deploying any additional dependencies such as peering or connections. This setup is ideal if you want to provision the circuit first and handle the dependent resources separately at a later stage.

## This example will:
 - Deploy an ExpressRoute Circuit in a specified region.
 - Output the Service Key required by your service provider to activate the circuit.
